# The Right Way To Note



## App Functionality

1. Implementation of Users Identification and Users Registeration 
	#### Be Remembered.
	- Authentication and validation inputs of the users when entering the app.
	- Future logins to the app after registeration to the app will auto log in the user.
		</br>
2. Implementation of Firebase Database Architecture
	- Data served by the app is handled by a RepositoryDataBase that implements Firebase.
	- Local data is saved in a singleton and DB.
		</br>

3. Implementation of Notes 
	#### Now, Notes Are More Than Just A Text.
	- Each Note can have a title, body, location (Assigned by translating Latitude and Longitutde into an address using a Geocoder) and an image.
	- Notes can be marked as "important notes", so they can not be instantly deleted and must be verified with a pre-assinged PIN code.
	#### Privacy. Because The Notes Are Yours.
  	- Notes are private and uniuqe for each user, and can not be shared between users or devices.
  	#### Experience Is Key.
	- Notes can be easliy filtered by any text using a search bar.
	- Deleting a Note , or peeking it's image , can be done simply with a swipe (With in-app instructions).
	- Inturducing a "young", colorful and dynamic UI for better experience.
	</br>
4. Implamantation of GoogleMaps - allows users to track Notes by location (Assigned by translating Latitude and Longitutde into an address using a Geocoder).
	#### Remember Where You Have Been.
	- Map Mode shows current user location.
  	- For each Note, Map shows a marker at the note location , with an attached details of the relavent Note (Title and address)
	-  Clicking on a Marker will transfer the user into the Note screen , with the option to view and edit the Note.
