# The Right Way To Note



## App Functionality

1. Implementation of Users Identification and Users Registeration 
	- Authentication and validation inputs of the users when entering the app.
	- Future logins to the app after registeration to the app will auto log in the user.
2. Implementation of Firebase Database Architecture
	- Data served by the app is handled by a RepositoryDataBase that implements Firebase.
	- Local data is saved in a singleton.
3. Implementation of Notes 
	- Each Note can have a title, body, location (Assigned by translating Latitude and Longitutde into an address using a Geocoder) and an image.
	- Notes can be marked as "important notes", so they can not be instantly deleted and must be verified with a pre - assinged PIN code.
  	- Notes are private and uniuqe for each user, and can not be shared between users or devices.
	- Notes can be filtered by any text using a search bar.
4. Implamantation of GoogleMaps that allows users to track Notes by location (Assigned by translating Latitude and Longitutde into an address using a Geocoder).
	- Map Mode shows current user location.
  	- For each Note, Map shows a marker at the note location , with an attached details of the relavent Note (Title and address)
	-  Clicking on a Marker will transfer the user into the Note screen , with the option to view and edit the Note.
